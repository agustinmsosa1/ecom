For conversions it is most prevalent that a customer does not have to scroll each page to view the meat of the product offering.<br />
<br />
This contribution spotlights the product offering by scrolling the product_info page to its value content on page load. And it gives the user full control to view the content as they want,.. with or without the HeaderScroll based on their selection and for the duration of their session.<br />
<br />
The customer's selection is saved to sessionStorage and applied to all product_info pages for the duration of their session.<br />

This is a simple header add-on that lets place categories at the top of your site.<br />
It&rsquo;s nothing fancy it just makes use of the stock osC categories function.<br />
It&rsquo;s best used for sites with a small number of cats. Also on mobile devices the cats are shown at the top of the device rather than at the bottom as is with stock CE.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a no core change add-on. Simply install and turn on like any other add-on.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s got some css in the temp file to show on install but you can remove that or override it in your user.css. The options for styling are endless. <br />
